# FX_deals

This project composed of a spring boot API & angular application as front-end interface

## Running instructions

### spring boot app :
this project is basically runnable on tomcat server but it can be modified to run on other servers and probably will not need any

### angular app :
this needs node.js to be installed so you can run npm commands and launch the application

### MySQL Database :
just include the database file to your MySQL Database on your server

# Notes :
All previous instructions could be replaced with a docker image that would be uploaded in the near future.
